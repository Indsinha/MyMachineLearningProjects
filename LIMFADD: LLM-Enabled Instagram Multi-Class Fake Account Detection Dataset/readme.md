## Problem Statement

Social media platforms like Instagram are increasingly exploited by malicious actors who create fake accounts to deceive users, disseminate spam, and perpetrate scams. Traditional detection datasets often simplify this challenge by categorizing accounts into binary classesâ€”real or fakeâ€”thereby overlooking the nuanced behaviors exhibited by various types of fraudulent accounts. This binary approach limits the effectiveness of detection models in identifying and mitigating diverse malicious activities.([ResearchGate][1], [Google Scholar][2])

## Project Overview

The LLM-Enabled Instagram Multi-Class Fake Account Detection Dataset (LIMFADD) addresses this limitation by introducing a multi-class classification framework. It categorizes Instagram accounts into four distinct classes:([TechRxiv][3], [Authorea][4])

* **Real Users**
* **Spam Bots**
* **Scam Accounts**
* **Bot Accounts**([ResearchGate][1])

By leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), LIMFADD enhances feature generation, enabling more accurate and granular detection of fake accounts. This dataset facilitates the development of sophisticated AI models that can better understand and counteract the varied strategies employed by malicious entities on social media platforms.([ResearchGate][1])

## Dataset Highlights

* **Multi-Class Classification**: Provides labels for four account types, moving beyond binary classification to capture the complexity of fake account behaviors.
* **LLM-Enhanced Features**: Utilizes LLMs to generate rich, contextual features that improve model training and detection accuracy.
* **Realistic Data Collection**: Includes data from genuine user accounts and various fake account types, ensuring a comprehensive representation of real-world scenarios.([Kaggle][5])
